				<h3 class="box-heading box-heading-1">solid</h3>
				<p class="box-content">In a solid, the particles (ions, atoms or molecules) are closely packed together. The forces between particles are strong so that the particles cannot move freely but can only vibrate. As a result, a solid has a stable, definite shape, and a definite volume. Solids can only change their shape by force, as when broken or cut.</p>

				<h3 class="box-heading box-heading-2">liquid</h3>
				<p class="box-content">A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure. The volume is definite if the temperature and pressure are constant. When a solid is heated above its melting point, it becomes liquid, given that the pressure is higher than the triple point of the substance. </p>

				<h3 class="box-heading box-heading-3">gas</h3>
				<p class="box-content">A gas is a compressible fluid. Not only will a gas conform to the shape of its container but it will also expand to fill the container.

                    In a gas, the molecules have enough kinetic energy so that the effect of intermolecular forces is small (or zero for an ideal gas), and the typical distance between neighboring molecules is much greater than the molecular size. A gas has no definite shape or volume, but occupies the entire container in which it is confined.</p>
